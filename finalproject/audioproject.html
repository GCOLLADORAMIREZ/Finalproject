	<p>The point of view of my piece is that you are a band from a nearby village that comes every week to this specific village and plays down their street. In the beginning, you hear the band on their way walking to the village. In the middle, you hear the band being greeted by the village that's excited. In the end, you just hear the band walking down the village play while the village is celebrating them. 
What inspired me to create this specifically is that my imaginary character lives in a world that's mostly full nature and villages. I also wanted to give her a childhood memory where when she was little she snuck into this village and saw the band walking down the road playing. I didnâ€™t use that many effects. I combined about three audio samples. The most challenging part of the project has to be finding the exact sound I wanted. I stuck with the sounds that I felt were close enough to the idea I had in my head.
